      <groupId>org.robovm</groupId>
      <artifactId>robovm-rt</artifactId>
      <version>${project.version}</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.robovm</groupId>
      <artifactId>robovm-cocoatouch</artifactId>
      <version>${project.version}</version>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
